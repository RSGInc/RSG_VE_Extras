## PredictWFH Module
#### June 13, 2022
#
#This module predicts the amount of time each worker in a household works from home and the resulting change in their commute distance
#
### Model Parameter Estimation
#
#See data-raw/DriversModel_df.R.
#
### How the Module Works
#
#The module assigns amount of teleworking to each worker in the household and the resulting change in their commute distance.
